<br> I see you hurt, I see you sufferin'
<br>You're not alone,
<br>in case you're wondering
<br>Oh you can come to me
<br>And lay your head on me
<br>Can see your lost,
<br>I see you strugglin'
<br>Can't even tell your friends
<br>from your enemies
<br>But you can come to me
<br>And lay your head on me

<br>Oh When you say you've given up
<br>When you say you had enough
<br>I'm thinking bout you always
<br>I'm thinking bout you always

<br>When the more you love,
<br>the more you lose
<br>The more I'm there for you
<br>I'm thinking bout you always
<br>I'm thinking bout you always

<br>So lay your head on me
<br>So lay your head on me

<br>And all the ones you thought
<br>would stick around
<br>I mean the ones you really cared about
<br>Tell me do they say
<br>Lay your head on me

<br>And I know when days are dark
<br>and you drown in everything
<br>And I know you try to numb
<br>cause' you don't wanna' feel a thing
<br>You know you can
<br>Lay your head on me

<br>Oh When you say you've given up
<br>When you say you had enough
<br>So lay your head on me
</P>
